### *sentify* is a simple and fast tool that converts documents to clean one sentence per line text files ready for NLP tools and Generative AI  processing

It currently handles local and remote *txt* and *pdf* files as well as Wikipedia *wikipage* given by their title.

See code in sentify.main function *sentify* for the simple, all in one API.

See tests/tests.py for testing out the API on several use cases.
